Unlock layers/group you're hovering over using ⌘L

## The problem
It’s a pain to unlock layers. Illustrator has a handy keyboard shortcut but Sketch doesn’t. So we made a plugin to do just that. [Learn more about it](https://medium.com/@stothelios/sketch-plugin-unlock-all-layers-1ff9252f0689)

## Usage
**To install it, simply [download the zip](https://github.com/truthlabs/sketch-unlock-all-layers/archive/master.zip) and double-click the “.sketchplugin” files.** You can access the plugin via the plugins menu or keyboard shortcut. You’ll know its worked when you see the notification at the bottom of the screen.

Here’s a screen capture of the plugin in action:
